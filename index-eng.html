            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am <strong>Tom Benchetrit</strong>, a technology enthusiast and web developer based in Paris. My
                professional journey began in the film industry as a set technician, where I had the opportunity to
                work on various projects and acquire valuable skills in collaboration, task management, and problem
                solving. However, my fascination for computers and the infinite possibilities of web development led me
                to
                embark on a new career path.<br>
                Recently graduated from the <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank"><strong>ADA Tech
                        School</strong></a>, an intensive training program in web
                development, I have developed a strong expertise in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and many other technologies. I am now seeking an
                internship opportunity in a tech company where I can put my skills and passion for development to good
                use.

                    My adventure at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank">ADA Tech School</a> marked the
                    beginning of my career transition, providing me with a
                    solid foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                    This experience allowed me to dive into the world of web development, with a pedagogy inspired by
                    Montessori that encourages self-learning and the development of essential skills such as
                    <strong>problem-solving</strong>, <strong>collaboration</strong>, and <strong>critical
                        thinking</strong>.<br><br>

                    Before turning to tech, I explored the world of cinema through my training at EICAR, where I spent
                    eight
                    years developing my storytelling skills and collaborating on various creative projects. This period
                    equipped me with a unique approach to visual storytelling and reinforced my ability to work as part
                    of a
                    team, valuable skills in the development of digital and interactive content.

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>My previous career as a <strong>set technician</strong> allowed me to gain valuable experience in the
                    film industry. As a technician, I was responsible for the <strong>management and maintenance of
                        equipment</strong>, as well as its deployment on set in accordance with safety standards. I
                    worked
                    closely with different teams to meet the technical and artistic needs of the projects, while
                    ensuring
                    a safe environment for the entire team. <br>
                    I have had the opportunity to work for brands such as Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Amazon, Disney,
                    as well as for artists like Hamza, Zazie, Django, and L'Artiste.</p>

            <div id="competences-content" class="sub-section-propos">
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>My technical skills extend to a deep expertise in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong>, with a particular mastery of <strong>React</strong> for frontend
                    development. I also have solid experience with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for responsive design
                    and <strong>TypeScript</strong> for robust and secure development. For backend, I have worked with
                    <strong>Laravel</strong>, a powerful PHP framework, allowing the creation of dynamic and scalable
                    web applications. In addition to my technical skills, I have developed skills in project management,
                    communication, and problem-solving. I am capable of working independently and in a team, allowing me
                    to approach projects with a holistic perspective and find efficient solutions. I use tools and
                    software such as <strong>VSCode</strong> for code editing and <strong>Node.js</strong> for
                    server-side development, ensuring a seamless integration between frontend and backend.

                <p>The <strong>Password Checker</strong> 🔒 project <br> is a tool designed to assess the security of
                    passwords. It analyzes
                    your password based on several criteria, including length, the presence of <strong>uppercase
                        letters</strong>,
                    <strong>digits</strong>, and <strong>special characters</strong>. It also checks passwords against a
                    blacklist of
                    <strong>several million commonly used passwords</strong>. The results are visually displayed with
                    security
                    indicators, allowing you to see whether your password is secure. The goal of this tool is to promote
                    better online
                    security practices. <br>

            <p><strong>Diverse Passions: Code, Music, and Sports</strong>
            <p>
                I love <strong>sports</strong> and <strong>video games</strong> because they really make me feel good.
                Plus, they keep me up-to-date with the latest tech and give me new ideas for my work. And I'm also a
                guitar teacher. It lets me share my passion for music and learn from others. This helps me develop
                patience, listening, and adaptability, which are super useful in teaching and coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies, including sports and video games , make me more <strong>determined</strong> and
                <strong>creative.</strong> They give me a
                unique perspective in the tech and music education fields. It really makes me appreciate what I do and
                motivates me to keep learning and growing. <br>
