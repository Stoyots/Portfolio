            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am <strong>Tom Benchetrit</strong>, a technology enthusiast and web developer based in Paris. My
                professional journey began in the film industry as a set technician, where I had the opportunity to
                work on various projects and acquire valuable skills in collaboration, task management, and problem
                solving. However, my fascination for computers and the infinite possibilities of web development led me to
                embark on a new career path.<br>
                Recently graduated from the <strong>ADA Tech School</strong>, an intensive training program in web
                development, I have developed a strong expertise in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and many other technologies. I am now seeking an
                internship opportunity in a tech company where I can put my skills and passion for development to good
                use.</p>

                <h3>Training</h3>
                <p><strong>Web Development Training at ADA Tech School</strong><br>
                    My adventure at ADA Tech School marked the beginning of my career transition, providing me with a
                    solid foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                    This experience allowed me to dive into the world of web development, with a pedagogy inspired by
                    Montessori that encourages self-learning and the development of essential skills such as
                    <strong>problem-solving</strong>, <strong>collaboration</strong>, and <strong>critical thinking</strong>.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cinema Experience at EICAR</strong><br>
                    Before turning to tech, I explored the world of cinema through my training at EICAR, where I spent eight
                    years developing my storytelling skills and collaborating on various creative projects. This period
                    equipped me with a unique approach to visual storytelling and reinforced my ability to work as part of a
                    team, valuable skills in the development of digital and interactive content.</p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>My previous career as a <strong>set technician</strong> allowed me to gain valuable experience in the
                    film industry. As a technician, I was responsible for the <strong>management and maintenance of
                        equipment</strong>, as well as its deployment on set in accordance with safety standards. I worked
                    closely with different teams to meet the technical and artistic needs of the projects, while ensuring
                    a safe environment for the entire team.</p>

                    software such as <strong>VSCode</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. In addition to my technical skills,
                    I have developed project management, communication, and problem-solving skills. I am able to work
