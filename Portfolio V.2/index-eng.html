            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Tom Benchetrit</strong>, a technology enthusiast and web developer based in Paris.
                My professional journey began in the film industry as a set technician, where I had the opportunity to
                work on various projects and acquire valuable skills in collaboration, task management, and problem
                solving. However, my fascination with computer science and the endless possibilities of web development
                led me to embark on a new career path. Recently graduated from the <strong>ADA Tech School</strong>, an
                intensive web development program, I have developed a strong expertise in <strong>HTML</strong>,
                <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and many other technologies.
                I am now seeking an internship opportunity in a tech company, where I can leverage my skills and passion
                for development.
